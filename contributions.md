# Contributions

Every member has to complete at least 2 meaningful tasks per week, where a
single development task should have a granularity of 0.5-1 day. The completed
tasks have to be shown in the weekly TA meetings. You have one "Joker" to miss
one weekly TA meeting and another "Joker" to once skip continuous progress over
the remaining weeks of the course. Please note that you cannot make up for
"missed" continuous progress, but you can "work ahead" by completing twice the
amount of work in one week to skip progress on a subsequent week without using
your "Joker". Please communicate your planning **ahead of time**.

Note: If a team member fails to show continuous progress after using their
Joker, they will individually fail the overall course (unless there is a valid
reason).

**You MUST**:

- Have two meaningful contributions per week.

**You CAN**:

- Have more than one commit per contribution.
- Have more than two contributions per week.
- Link issues to contributions descriptions for better traceability.

**You CANNOT**:

- Link the same commit more than once.
- Use a commit authored by another GitHub user.

Removed the redundant FriendRepository interface. Deleted lobby name parameter from DTO and corresponding files. Delete ranked / unranked game types, force to use isPrivate Boolean instead, to avoid redundant functionality. Don’t request round cards from the client, instead provide the list of round cards as a response on the lobby creation. The lobby service generates default round cards when creating a new lobby. Delete the team name field from request and response DTOs. Make available to update maxPlayersPerTeam and MaxPlayers for the lobby/config endpoint; Once the lobby is created, add the lobby code immediately. Add an API endpoint to retrieve all active lobbies (Finish task #275, in the commit stated as 257 - typo). | Relevant for the game logic and updated based on the client requirements and adjustments to the specifications. |
